Utilities to delete emails from your Gmail via Imap.

For now there is a [marimo notebook](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) that downloads some header information of all emails and stores it as a csv.

Ideas/Roadmap:

- [ ] only use pure emails for To/From
- [ ] Table view
- [ ] Sort & Filter
- [ ] Visuzalize as treemap and possible sunburst chart
- [ ] ability to bulk delete emails
